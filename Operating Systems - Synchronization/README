The goal of this project was to implement a extended version of the classic Sleeping Barber problem. 
However in this project, there were multiple "barbers" and "customers", and the add addition of a coordinator to act between the two.

To achieve this, the program heavily uses semaphores, threads, and other synchronization techniques.
