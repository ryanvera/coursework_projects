The goal of this project was to use the Scikit-Learn library to train, validate, and test various machine learning algorithms.

The algorithms implemented are decision trees and random forests. These use bagging and boostrapping techniques within themselves.
Scikit-Learn's GridSearch feature was utilized to select the best hyperparameters for each model.
