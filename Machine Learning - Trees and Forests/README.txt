Project 2

All source code was developing VSCode and Juypter Notebooks
Libraries used: Pandas, Scikit Learn


The "project2_data" folder was modified to have a shorter path.

All source code resides with the "src" folder.
	bagging_tree_classifier.ipynb contains the Bagging Tree Classifier
	decision_tree_classifier.ipynb contains the basic Decision Tree Classifier
	gradient_boost_classifier.ipynb contains the Gradient Boosting Classifier
	mninst_classifier.ipynb contains all the classifiers trained and tested on the MNIST dataset
	random_forest_classifier.ipynb contains the Random Forest Classifier

	In each juypter notebook, in the second cell, there is a variable (dataFileKeyNum) that can be changed to choice which dataset to load.

	The classifiers that are run on the MNIST data are all initalized to their default values


The tabular data of the best hyperparameters and scorings of each classifier on each data set can be found in "classification_result.xlxs"
